This is a compilation of the best work throughout my Data Analysis Course (SIS-750-007) at American University during the Spring Semester of 2024. The reader will find an insightful presentation, a detailed poster, a copy of an exemplary code chunk, and a comprehensive analyst resume. These three files will allow the reader an insight to my proficiency in data analysis and visualization using R Markdown. 

The Poster was an assignment that required us to use R Markdown to highlight our ability to complete an empirical research project as a data analyst. The task was to ask and answer an empirical question using appropriate data and statistical analysis. The challenge was to present the work in a single poster in a way that is both sophisticated and understandable to an audience from diverse backgrounds. You can find the RMD file under “KarenPoster” and see the final product under “Internet Access and Freedom Poster PDF.”

The Presentation assignment that required us to use R Markdown was meant to highlight our skills with visualization. The presentation includes a topical motivation, description of the data, and two slides of analysis. I took this opportunity to investigate Nicaragua’s Interest in Politics vs. Satisfaction with Government - Compared to Latin America. To see the final version of my analysis you can find it under “FINAL Presentation Nicaraguans and LA” and find the RMD file under “Final Presentation KPT – Revised”. 

The code chunk that I believe highlights my analysis and coding skills can be found under “Code chunk.” In pages 1-4, the file highlights the wrangling of data, the use of R Markdown, my demonstration of packages like ggplot2, tidyverse, and knitr to showcase a thorough analysis of the impacts of Covid across the United States. 

Lastly, the analyst resume was an assignment to showcase the skills we obtained throughout this course. It highlights the experience I have obtained in the field of data analytics and international affairs. To any potential employers, please note that I will provide my full resume upon request.
